        <p class="left">Linda "L.J." Yockey was born in raised in Lancaster, CA. Upon graduating high school, she moved to Hollywood with the dream of following a music career. That dream quickly gave way to personal issues, and Yockey found herself moving to Las Vegas in 2013 to start a new life. Yockey briefly took interest in law enforcement and excelled in Casino Security. While she was good at it, Yockey knew that law enforcement wasn't the job for her.</p>
        <p class="right">An acquaintence from work noticed that Yockey was young and computer savvy. This acquainence suggested that Yockey look up code.org. Yockey was quickly amazed by how easy and fun it was to create code using block models. Yockey discovered Harvard's CS50x while browsing code.org and, from there, codecademy, where she has learned most of her skills.</p>
        <p class="center">While Yockey is not at work or coding, she spends most of her free time with friends, family and her fianc&eacute;, Tabitha. Yockey is looking forward to getting married and starting a new career as a web developer all within the same year.</p>
